            <h2>Celebrating the creativity of emerging artists for 50 years</h2>

            <p>The Jerome Foundation celebrates its 50th Anniversary in 2014 by honoring the creation, development, and production of new work by emerging artists, and the organizations that support them.</p>

            <p>The Avon Foundation, created by artist and philanthropist Jerome Hill, submitted Articles of Incorporation to the State of Minnesota, and was recognized as a Nonprofit Corporation by the Secretary of State.  The Foundation was given a broad charitable purpose and its duration was to be perpetual.  </p>

            <p>In its first two meetings, six grants were made, of which three supported filmmakers and filmmaking, an area in which Jerome Hill had experience and to which he was highly committed.  The Jerome Foundation has continued that commitment over the past 50 years.</p>

        <p>From 1968  to 1972,  ten to twenty grants were authorized each year in New York, Minnesota, and other areas of the country to arts and humanities organizations and individuals whom Jerome Hill knew and wished to support.</p>


         <p>The Foundation provided support for the design and construction of a Film Repertory Theatre in The Public Theatre, New York City.  This project was conceived by Anthology Film Archives to show experimental and avant garde film in an optimal viewing environment. </p>

            <p>The Foundation’s objectives were the encouragement of experimental, innovative and creative endeavors in the arts and humanities, and the promotion of the arts and humanities as integral parts of American life.

This focus has continued for 37 years.</p>

                    <p>In its early years, the Foundation made grants to individual filmmakers and to film organizations that Jerome Hill wanted to support. In 1978, the Foundation structured its program of production grants for film and video directors in the form of the New York City Film and Video Program. In 1993, it did the same with the Minnesota Film and Video Program. From 1978 to 1993, grants to Minnesota film and video directors were made through a program operated by Film in the Cities.</p>

                    <p>Over 50 years, 347 grants totaling $2,9978,700 were made to film and video directors in Minnesota and the four surrounding states. In the same 50 years, 509 grants totaling $6,027,273 were made to film and video directors in New York City.</p>

                    <p>These productions speak to the value the Foundation places on the individual creative voice.</p>
