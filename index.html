							<p>The Avon Foundation, created by artist and philanthropist Jerome Hill, submitted Articles of Incorporation to the State of Minnesota, and was recognized as a Nonprofit Corporation by the Secretary of State.  The Foundation was given a broad charitable purpose and its duration was to be perpetual.  </p>

							<p>In its first two meetings, six grants were made, of which three supported filmmakers and filmmaking, an area in which Jerome Hill had experience and to which he was highly committed.  The Jerome Foundation has continued that commitment over the past 50 years.</p>

These grant relationships can be sustained over extended periods of time. Some date back to the Foundation's first decade of grantmaking.</p>

					<p>The program has been supported by the General Mills Foundation (1988-2014), the Art and Martha Kaemmer Fund of HRK Foundation (2002-2014), the Dayton Hudson and Target Foundations (1986-2001), and the Jerome Foundation (1986-2014).</p>

					<h2>Film and Video Production Support for Individual Artists</h2>
					<h3>856 Grants in 50 Years</h3>

					<p>In its early years, the Foundation made grants to individual filmmakers and to film organizations that Jerome Hill wanted to support. In 1978, the Foundation structured its program of production grants for film and video directors in the form of the New York City Film and Video Program. In 1993, it did the same with the Minnesota Film and Video Program. From 1978 to 1993, grants to Minnesota film and video directors were made through a program operated by Film in the Cities.

<p>Over 50 years, 347 grants totaling $2,987,000 were made to film and video directors in Minnesota and the four surrounding states. In the same 50 years, 509 grants totaling $6,266,000 were made to film and video directors in New York City.
</p>

<p>These productions speak to the value the Foundation places on the individual creative voice.
